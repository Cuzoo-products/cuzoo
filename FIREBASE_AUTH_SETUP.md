## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

- `src/services/authService.ts` - Firebase authentication service
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Custom React hook for authentication state
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_SETUP.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:

- `src/firebase.ts` - Updated Firebase configuration
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated authentication with login form
- `src/main.tsx` - Added Toaster component for notifications

## How to Use

### 1. Login

- Enter your email and password in the login form
- Click "Sign In" button
- Success: You'll see a welcome dashboard with user information
- Error: You'll see a toast notification with the error message

### 2. Sign Out

- When logged in, click the "Sign Out" button
- You'll be redirected back to the login form

### 3. Authentication State

- The app automatically detects if you're logged in
- Shows loading spinner while checking authentication
- Persists login state across browser refreshes

## Firebase Configuration

The Firebase project is already configured with:

- Project ID: `cuzoo-backend`
- Authentication enabled for email/password
- All necessary Firebase services initialized

## Error Messages

The app provides user-friendly error messages for common scenarios:

- Invalid email format
- Wrong password
- User not found
- Network errors
- Too many failed attempts
- Account disabled

## Development Notes

- Uses Firebase v11.10.0
- Implements proper TypeScript types
- Follows React best practices with custom hooks
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Uses Sonner for toast notifications
- Integrates with existing form validation (Zod)

## Next Steps

To extend this authentication system, you can:

1. Add password reset functionality
2. Implement email verification
3. Add social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
4. Create user profiles and additional user data
5. Add role-based access control
6. Implement protected routes

## Testing

To test the authentication:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try logging in with a valid email/password
3. Test error scenarios (wrong password, invalid email)
4. Test sign out functionality
5. Refresh the page to verify state persistence
